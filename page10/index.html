<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/01/07/gimp-image-editing-winter-2011/">Gimp Image Editing - Winter 2011</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-07-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, at 7 pm in <strong>Dreese Labs room 264</strong>, Brian Swaney will be demonstrating use of the GIMP image editor. GIMP is what some might consider an open source alternative to the proprietary $800 Photoshop application, except that many people refuse to consider it on the grounds that it is allegedly inferior, and therefore unusable. While I’m not familiar with Photoshop, I will debunk the myth about GIMP being unusable, and show just how powerful GIMP can be for those who take the time to learn it. I’ll do this by teaching you how to perform arbitrary Photoshop-esque techniques in GIMP.</p>

<p>For those who don’t remember, I did promise to cover the new Gimp 2.8, which was scheduled to be released December 27<sup>th</sup>, 2010<sup>[<a href="http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/news/gimp-2-8-release-date-announced/">1</a>]</sup>. However, Gimp 2.8 has not yet been released. I expect to have the beta version (2.7.1) as well as the stable version (2.6.10) in case things go wrong. The gimp 2.7 may be unstable, so I can make no promises, and I am aware of at least one feature anticipated in 2.8 that is not included in the 2.7.1 version I found.</p>

<p>Image manipulation is done a by-case basis, so what works on one image may not work on another. Use of these editors is best learned by practice, as opposed to lectures, so the presentation will be interactive and based on audience feedback. Use of a laptop with GIMP already installed was recommended. Questions are also encouraged, so please come prepared with ideas of what you would like to see - as basic as “<em>how do I save as a JPEG</em>” to as advanced as “<em>how do I remove braces?</em>” or anything else you can think of. Asking your questions below in advance will help me to prepare relevant content for you.</p>

<p>While I have some example content, basic to advanced, the talk will be focused on what <em>you</em> want to cover. This can be anything from a quick adjustment of the color/contrast/angle for your pictures, to completely removing a girlfriend/parent/sibling, to <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/lightning.xcf">rendering lightning bolts</a>, to making the picture just… <a href="/%7Eswaneybr/images/stallman-gates.xcf">lie</a>. By the time you leave, you should qualify as a <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200807020002?f=h_top">Fox News editor</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a time-lapsed example of what GIMP is capable of in the right hands, by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hmfrx">hmfrx</a>:</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/01/04/osu-sign-on-and-openid-now-supported/">OSU Sign-on and OpenID Now Supported</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-04-2011</span>
<p>In response to feedback we received about having to log into our site (and resetting passwords each time), as well as insanely difficult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">CAPTCHA</a>s, we have taken steps to make things a little easier for everyone. Effective immediately, an OSU <code class="highlighter-rouge">name.n</code> will now log any current student, faculty, or staff member into our website, as well as most alumni and former staff. To use it, simply click the link on the left-side of any page titled “OSU Sign-on” and enter your OSU username and password (same password you use for Carmen/grades/etc). Logging in this way will automatically mark your account as <a href="/node/9">identified</a> and give you the ability to post anything without moderator approval, as well as any other options previously unavailable to anonymous or unverified users.</p>

<p>Additionally, we support OpenID. Unlike with your OSU login (which uses Shibboleth), an OpenID will not automatically flagg your account as identified if you register a new account with it. However, you may tie unlimited OpenIDs to your verified account. Using either OpenID or your OSU sign-on, you can now log into our website without ever having to enter a password in our site.</p>

<p>The first time you log in or register on this website, you may need to follow these instructions for one of 3 methods. It is possible to use all or any combination of them to use our website, and you can tie all 3 methods to the same account. This page documents how to use each of the methods and the advantages and disadvantages of each, as well as what to do if you have never signed into our website before. You should wind up with the same privileges no matter which method you use. This page does <em>not</em> talk about club membership; we do not formally keep track of membership except as absolutely required by the Ohio State University to maintain formal status as a registered student organization. If you are still looking to be recognized as a member to any degree, we recommend you attend our weekly <a href="/meetings">meetings</a>, register on our <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource">mailing list</a>, and register on this website (instructions below). <strong>NOTE:</strong> We recommend using the same e-mail address on the mailing list and this website (<a href="/mailinglist-info">read more</a>).</p>

<h3 id="osu-sign-on">OSU Sign-on:</h3>

<p>If you are an OSU student, faculty, or staff member, it is recommended that you sign into this website with your OSU internet username, at least the first time you use our website. Do <strong>not</strong> enter this information into our <a href="/user/login" title="login form">login form</a> that appears on every page, but instead use the “<a href="https://opensource.cse.ohio-state.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login?target=https%3A%2F%2Fopensource.cse.ohio-state.edu%2Fshib_login%2Fnode" title="OSU Sign-on">OSU Sign-on</a>” link - your OSU username and password are considered restricted information, and they are not stored on this website, but verified to us by another OSU service. This login is the same as what you log into for your e-mail, grades, Carmen, and a number of other services, and as long as you are affiliated with OSU in some fashion, you can continue to authenticate through the web authentication service. If you sign in this way, you will <em>automatically</em> inherit privileges of an <a href="/get_verified" title="approved account">approved account</a> for the duration of your session, and within a day OpenID or Drupal sign-ins should include these privileges as well. These privileges may include but are not limited to viewing user profiles, posting content that isn’t sent to a moderation queue (as is the case for anonymous submissions), or voting on polls. You cannot use this option if you are not affiliated with OSU, but you can still gain full access to our website by the methods below.</p>

<p>After your first time logging in, we recommend that you initiate a password reset by signing out and clicking on “<a href="/user/password" title="Request new password">Request new password</a>” so you can set a separate password for your account. Although you can continue logging in with your OSU username and password as long as you’re affiliated, once you graduate OSU and your name.n stops working, will no longer be able to sign in with your name.n. Initiating a password reset “confirms” your account, for technical purposes I won’t explain here, and allows you to sign in without OSU’s single sign-on service (Shibboleth). Once you do this, you can (optionally) set your own password, or add an OpenID so you can sign in with a 3rd-party service.</p>

<h3 id="openid">OpenID:</h3>

<p>You can tie an OpenID to your account from your user <a href="/user" title="profile page">profile page</a> and clicking on the tab labeled <strong>OpenID Identities</strong>. All accounts have permission to do this, and doing so (like with the OSU sign-on) allows you to sign in without entering a password into this website, so you don’t have to create a new password or worry about repeating the same password here as on another website. There is no limit on the number of OpenIDs you can tie to a single account, but we recommend you tie all OpenIDs to your existing <a href="/get_verified" title="verified">verified</a> account instead of creating multiple accounts.</p>

<p>If you do not already have an account on this website, you can register with OpenID, but you will have the same limited privileges as if you register directly, and you won’t have the opportunity to pick your username. Of course, this means you’re entering a password into our website, but you could always just enter something random you’re never going to use (please use a <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords" title="strong password">strong password</a>) then tie the OpenID to your account and use that. If you’re affiliated with OSU, you can also follow the instructions to enable OpenID for your OSU sign-on, and you’ll have full access from OpenID but you will be forced to use your name.n as the username (if you’re just logging in the first time it may take up to a day for the new privileges to migrate over to OpenID).</p>

<p>If you do not have an OSU account, and are not affiliated with the Ohio State University, you are more than welcome to use this website fully, but you will have to have your account <a href="/get_verified" title="verified">verified</a>. This can be done in person with the club’s administration, or by immediately setting your e-mail address to something verifiable when you first sign in. If you do not set it right away on your first time logging in, chances are an administrator will overlook your account and you will need to fill out a <a href="/contact" title="support request">support request</a>. Examples of such e-mail addresses are <code class="highlighter-rouge">SOME_USER</code>@XXX.gov, <code class="highlighter-rouge">STUDENT</code>@<code class="highlighter-rouge">SCHOOL</code>.edu, or something with a clear name from a well-known organization (e.g. fsf.org) where creating multiple free e-mail addresses is out of the question. Examples of e-mail addresses that will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> verify your account are crackmonkey79@gmail.com, anon007@mailinator.com, or viagra@provider.ru. Despite this, registration on our website is completely open. Anybody is welcome on our website, and these account limitations for unidentified users are exclusively meant as an anti-spam measure, not to restrict users.</p>

<h3 id="drupal-sign-in-local">Drupal sign-in (local):</h3>

<p>In addition to the methods above, you may also register directly (local) on our website. The advantage to registering this way is that you get to pick your username, which would automatically be assigned if you use Shibboleth or OpenID. You do not need to be affiliated with the Ohio State University to use this method, but keep in mind that if you are affiliated with OSU then you will need to use your name.n username if you want your account to be compatible with your OSU account. A conflicting username <em>can</em> lock you out from your OSU login. Only an administrator can change your username, and this is the only way to correct the problems that will arise if you try to use your OSU login later on. If you’re not affiliated with OSU, or you have no intention of using the OSU login service, then this doesn’t apply to you. Also, do <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> register with the name.n of someone else — it’s not funny, it’s not cute, it won’t accomplish anything for you. We’ve already tested that, and if some wise-ass thinks otherwise, tries it, and the account doesn’t get flagged for abuse, then here’s what will happen: then the next time the owner of that squatted OSU username logs into our site through the OSU login service, they will take control of that account you just registered and automatically reset the password and e-mail address to their own — congratulations, your cleverness just got your <em>OWN</em> account p0wned and you effectively banned yourself from our website.</p>

<p>As with OpenID, you <em>must</em> use a verifiable e-mail address to be granted full access to our website. Although you can immediately sign in, add OpenID accounts, and post with your selected username, you will not be granted full access automatically, and you will have to wait for an administrator to approve your account. This usually happens within less than 1 day, as administrators are automatically alerted about the account creation, but over holidays or breaks when the administrators are not around, it can potentially take longer. Because of this delay, OSU faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to follow the instructions above for using their OSU credentials to access this website; sessions created by the OSU login service are granted full privileges automatically.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/01/01/chroot-and-linux-from-scatch/">Chroot and Linux From Scatch</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 01-01-2011</span>
<p>Thursday, January 6th, 2011 at 7:00PM in Dreese 264 (note the change in location), Daniel Thau will be giving a dual presentation covering the chroot operation as well as the Linux From Scratch project.</p>

<p>Chroot, available on all major Unix-y systems, changes the root directory from the point of a selected program and its children.  Effectively, this is somewhat akin to vitalization (with a number of comparative benefits and deficiencies relative to actual vitalization).  Some uses of chroot include the creation of a testing environment, a separated environment for compatibility reasons, limited privilege separation, and recovery of unbootable or otherwise hampered systems.  While chroot is available on other Unix-y systems, the presentation will focus on it’s uses with Linux distributions.</p>

<p>The other topic, Linux From Scratch, is a collection of documentation which walks a user through the processes of creating a functional Linux distribution.  While the base LFS system is fairly minimal, LFS has sister projects (such as Beyond Linux From Scratch) which allow a LFS-based system to (after a lot of work) fit the needs of almost any type of Linux distribution, from an extremely minimal embedded system to a fully featured desktop or server.  More important, perhaps, is the fact that working through the LFS documentation is a great way to learn about the innards of a Linux system.</p>

<p>The week of December 3 is final exams, so we will not be meeting. In addition, the next few weeks are winter break, so our next meeting is Thursday, January 10 at 7 PM. The topic and location are currently unknown. During this break, our <a href="/irc">irc channel</a> and <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/opensource">mailing list</a> should still be active and many will be working on projects, <a href="/git">some of which</a> are hosted on our website.

<p>December 2nd at 7:00PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Vim, an extremely powerful text editing program.  Vim is known for having a difficult learning curve, but for many of those who do any appreciable amount of work editing text (such as Unix configuration, programming, etc) the benefits can far outweigh the cost.</p>

<p>Daniel will cover Vim’s basic concepts and should get most who know nothing about Vim up to the point where they can use it.  Additionally, Daniel will cover several more advanced concepts such as folding, q-macros, blockwise-visual tricks, and others.  Feel free to come in with questions on anything Vim.</p>

<p>Vim is available on Windows, Macs, Linux and others.  If you’ve got a laptop, it may be a good idea to install vim and bring it in; playing with the aspects of Vim introduced are a great way to learn about them.</p>

<p>Additionally, we will use this meeting to plan out our schedule for next quarter.  Bring in any ideas you have!</p>

<p>This <strong><em>Friday</em></strong>, November 12th at 7:00PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on Git, a distributed version control system with a focus on performance and integrity. Despite being known as one of the more difficult VCSs to grasp, git has become quite popular and has a fair number of recognizable F/OSS projects using it, such as the Linux Kernel and X.org. Daniel will cover a quick history of Git (lots of tasty drama), cover some pros and cons of using Git, explain what Git is doing under the hood, give a conceptual explanation of what Git does, and of course go over both basic (add, commit, branch, merge, etc) and advanced (stash, rebase, etc) Git usage. Having a laptop with Git installed may be benficial for those in the audience who want to play along, but those without should be perfectly fine. NOTE: Due to veterans day this meeting is on a Friday, not a Thursday!</p>

<p>This Thursday, October 28 at 7PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Alex Lingo will be presenting an old club favorite known as “This Week in Slashdot”. <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> (commonly abbreviated as /.) is a website that deals in news for the nerdy, specifically “stuff that matters”. Readers submit articles which are then accepted or rejected by editors and published on the site. From there, the readers have huge discussions about every aspect of the article which can be very funny/interesting/insightful/etc and oft prove to be a very good read. Historically, the site has a history of having a pro open source bias, which is why we like it. Alex would like to take this format and apply it to a club meeting so that we can have similar discussions amongst our members in real time. No prior knowledge of /., or goings on in the world, is necessary to participate. Read Slashdot prior to the meeting if you wish and bring your thoughts, opinions, ideas, rants, raves and what have you. This may be Alex’s last quarter at Ohio State, so don’t miss this meeting! It should also be noted that award certificates will be given out to those who can show that they’ve received a comment moderated 3 or better within the last week! There will also be candy tossed out for valuable participation in the discussions during the meeting.</p>

<p>On Thursday, October 7th at 7PM in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Alek Rollyson will be explaining what Mutt is, what it does, and why you should care. Per Mutt’s mantra, most e-mail clients suck, Mutt just sucks less. Alek will be showcasing Mutt’s capabilities via the story of Mua the Mutt and the adventures in which she partakes. Through a storytelling device, he will explain that Mutt is solely a mail user agent and requires other pieces and parts in order to function as a complete email solution. Once the entire system is complete, the user will have powerful regex capabilities, email threading, offline email access, pgp encryption and signing, sending and receiving from multiple addresses, 256 color inbox sorting, and synching with gmail if one wishes. This meeting will be perfect for those who are scared of Mutt’s complexity, tried Mutt and got frustrated, looking to improve their Mutt setup, or have no idea what Mutt is but want an extremely powerful and 1337 email setup.</p>

<p>This Thursday, at 7 pm in the Ohio Union Senate Chamber, Matt Smith will be demonstrating an Open Music Server that he has been working on. It might seem too easy and obvious to bother with in this day and age. We all know how to rip CD’s, collect and share music, and move it to our portables for on-the-go music. My server comes from an audiophile standpoint. Long story short, I used to sell expensive stereo equipment. There are people out there right now spending up to $60,000 on CD players. I’d like to show you how to build your own that competes with these on sound quality, is easier to use, much more fun, has more features, and is completely free. edit: my blog: http://opensourceaudiophile.com/</p>

<p>Thursday, September 23 is the first meeting of autumn quarter. We will be meeting in the Ohio Union Senate Room (note the change in location from last year) at 7PM. After a short introduction of the club and a brief description of the blood drive we are sponsoring on the 30th, Matt Meinwald will present an overview of Free operating systems, focusing primarily on GNU/Linux distributions. The main software component of a computer is its operating system, and it is good to know we have plenty of Free and Open Source options for this important role. Matt will discuss and demo popular desktop GNU/Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Mandriva, and OpenSuse, then if time remains, will open discussion to anyone who wishes to talk about his/her favorite distribution. As it turned out, most everyone already knew about these topics, so we discussed what the club does and future meeitngs instead of the original topic. <a href="/~paradigm/minutes.html#htoc7">Minutes</a> for this meeting</p>
