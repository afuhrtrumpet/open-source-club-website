<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/05/22/arduino/">Arduino</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-22-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, May 26 at 7PM, we will be meeting in <strong><em>Hitchcock 224</em></strong> where First Year Engineering staff will present on Arduino.</p>

<p>Come to a hands-on open hardware/open source Arduino microcontroller introduction given by the staff of First Year Engineering (FYE) program with an emphasis on their new lab centered about the “Advance Energy Vehicle (AEV),” controlled, of course, by an Arduino.  FYE will supply computer accounts and breadboards with installed Arduinos, so you can cruise through some simple hands-on examples of controlling motors, servos, acquiring analog data, reading and writing to digital pins, and effectively using interrupts (simpler than you would imagine) with this simple eight bit device.  A Matlab/Arduino interface created by Dr. Campa at Mathworks will be displayed, including a “real-time” data graphing example along with simple servo and motor control.  Some other Arduino related tools, such as the fritzing.org software, will also be displayed and discussed.  A pitch will be given for ideas, and possibly programming help, in simplifying the AEV code as much as possible for students with Matlab, but no C++, background.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered what functional programming is all about or how to use funky languages people are always talking about? This Thursday, May 19 at 7PM in Dreese 264, Alex Burkhart will describe the basic concept of functional programming and introduce us to Haskell. Next, Silas Baronda will present Erlang.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/05/08/lan-party/">LAN Party</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-08-2011</span>
<p>On Saturday, May 14, from 10:00<strong>AM</strong> to 11:30<strong>PM</strong> in the Ohio Union <a href="http://ohiounion.osu.edu/visit_the_union/building_map/basement">Creative Arts room</a>. The emphasis will be on Free, Open Source games, but people are welcome to play whatever they’d like. Additional details can be found at the <a href="/lan">LAN website</a> as well as a registration form, to help us get a feel for how many people we will have and what games you want to play. Please bring your computer, any game media you might need, as well as a network cable or two, in case some people do not have one. If you have any questions, please send an email to lan@opensource.osu.edu.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/05/03/elections/">Elections</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 05-03-2011</span>
<p>Club elections will be held May 12, 2011. If you are interested in running, please email elections@opensource.osu.edu in order to be listed here and in the meeting announcement. Any OSU student who has been to at least one meeting is eligible to run for president, vice president, or treasurer.</p>

<p>The following people have announced their candidacy.</p>

<p>President: Daniel Thau
Vice President: Paul Schwendenman, Brian Swaney (tentative)
Treasurer: Joel Friedly</p>

<p>In addition, Brian Swaney has proposed the following ballot initiative.</p>

<p>With most discussion surrounding ACTA/COCIA/SHIELD and Wikileaks ex post facto legislation died down, the immediate urgency with which it was hastily voted on and posted is alleviated. The senator who introduced the Espionage amendment (SHIELD Act, by John Ensign R-NV) which sparked this movement is also no longer in office, although a key co-sponsor Joe Lieberman I-CT is still in office. Therefore, during the election procedure I believe we should also vote on its removal. While the Open Source Club will continue its endorsement of EFF, it no longer seems necessary to keep extra clutter on our web page. <em>Shall the Ohio State University Open Source Club remove the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s “Say NO to online censorship” button?</em></p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/30/mandatory-access-control/">Mandatory Access Control</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-30-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, May 5th at 7PM in Dreese Labs 264, Daniel Thau and Alek Rollyson will be presenting on Linux Mandatory Access Control (MAC). MAC is a different approach to computer security from the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) that is the default for Windows, Macs, most Linux distros, and most other Unixy operating systems. The basic concepts behind MAC will be explained, contrasted against DAC, and various options for MAC on Linux will be covered (with specific focus given to SELinux and TOMOYO Linux). Additionally, a several applications of MAC will be demonstrated, such as locking down xpdf (a Linux pdf reader) with TOMOYO Linux.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/26/cli-utilities/">CLI Utilities</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-26-2011</span>
<p>On Thursday, April 28, at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will have lightning talks about programs with a command-line interface (CLI). These utilities can be useful in their own right, but often can be connected together with pipes to do new and interesting things. It would be helpful if people interested in presenting signed up with their choices, either by emailing me at meinwald.1@osu.edu or commenting below. This way we can avoid duplication. For now assume each talk can be up to 5 minutes, but that is subject to change.</p>

<p>So far the following people have signed up.</p>

<p>Dan Thau: awk, clive, busybox, graft, pwd, whoami
Morgan Goose: netcat, tar, rsync, iperf, tee
Matt Meinwald: curl, wget
Alek Rollyson: tshark, offlineimap, slock, packer, gnupg, rtorrent</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/18/breaking-stuff/">Breaking Stuff</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-18-2011</span>
<p>Have you ever run “rm -rf” on the wrong directory, ran “rsync” the wrong way, observed unintended consequences with “find,” or locked yourself out of your own computer? If you can answer yes to any of these and would like to know what else to avoid, or if you can’t and would like to keep it that way, please join us as various club members present how to break things! Everyone who has a story or a deadly command, please come and share it with us, no prior approval needed. Everyone else, prepare to be entertained.</p>

<p>As usual, we will be meeting on Thursday at 7PM in Dreese 264.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/09/go-board-game-ai/">Go (board game) AI</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-09-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, April 14th at 7PM in Dreese 264, Daniel Thau will be giving a presentation on open source artificial intelligence for the board game Go.</p>

<p>Go is an ancient board game (estimated to be 2000-4000 years old) which, despite a simple rule set, is extremely difficult to write a human-level AI for.  Unlike comparable board games such as Chess, the best Go AI’s in the world were not match against strong club players only a few years ago, and despite significant development recently they are still no match for weaker professional Go players today.</p>

<p>Daniel will be discussing why humans are so much better than computers at Go despite the simple rule set and two general approaches taken by open source Go AI developers.</p>

<p>The talk is intended to be interesting to seasoned Go players and AI hobbyists as well as those who know nothing about about the game or AI development.</p>

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/04/open-source-security-tools/">Open Source Security Tools</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-04-2011</span>
<p>This Thursday, April 7 at 7PM in Dreese 264, Alek Rollyson will be covering open source security tools from protocol analyzers to vulnerability scanners. This talk is meant as a general overview of tools available as well as their practical applications in security audits and penetration testing. Tools and topics covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wireshark (protocol analyzer)</li>
  <li>Metasploit (penetration testing suite)</li>
  <li>Ettercap (multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN)</li>
  <li>Aircrack-ng (set of tools for testing wireless security)</li>
  <li>OpenVAS (open source replacement for Nessus, a vulnerability scanner)</li>
  <li>Nmap (swiss army port scanner)</li>
  <li>Password Crackers (John the Ripper, Ophcrack)</li>
  <li>Distros such as Backtrack, Knoppix STD, Damn Vulnerable Linux</li>
  <li>Kippo (simple honeypot with recording capabilities)</li>
  <li>A few hardening techniques and tools (mandatory access control, port knocking, intrusion detection tools, common sense things, old wive’s tales)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This talk is meant for educational purposes only. Techniques demonstrated should only be used on your own systems as using any of these techniques on systems that you do not own has a high probability of you ending up behind bars. These tools will be presented from the perspective of a security auditor and/or a systems administrator wishing to find weak spots in his or her own defenses.

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/04/01/new-microsoft-partnership/">New Microsoft Partnership</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 04-01-2011</span>
<p>Amidst our past rivalry, and a fellow technology group that has been all but extinct, we in the Ohio State University Open Source Club have hereby formed a new partnership with the now re-established <a href="http://mail.cse.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/ntsig">ntSig</a> (website coming soon). ntSig, or New Technology Special Interest Group, is a group sponsored by Microsoft for people who share an interest in software, computers and technology in general. This carefully considered decision was not made lightly, but we wish to honor some of our former members who now reside in Redmond, WA and set our political differences aside.</p>

<p>After much deliberation, out of respect for many of our former members, we in the Open Source Club administration have decided to partner with Microsoft. Despite our general hostility, and Microsoft’s apparent attitude toward our philosophy, Microsoft has always been friendly to the club. We in the Open Source Club have at times been <a href="/vista">hostile</a> towards the Microsoft club and their events, but have now come to realize what Visual Studio has to offer the community. As part of our partnership, all members are now encouraged to sign in with their Windows Live ID, using the link on the left. Additionally, our website search has been replaced with <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> Search. In return for this sponsorship, Microsoft will provide all Linux users willing to format their drives with a free copy of Windows 7 Home Basic (coming soon). Additionally, as part of our partnership, all registration information may be shared with Microsoft or its affiliates unless you <a href="/ntsig">opt out</a>.</p>

<h3 id="april-fools">APRIL FOOLS!!!</h3>

<p>We currently have no intention of partnering with Microsoft, and as far as we know the ntSig club remains inactive. This has been a well-meaning hoax by your webmaster. Furthermore, we will never share your information with anyone under any circumstances, per our <a href="/rules">terms of use</a>.</p>

<p>If you liked this April Fools’ Day joke, you can check out an example of another related website hoax <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">here</a>.</p>

Alek Rollyson will present Window Manager From Scratch. Alex Lingo will talk about KDE. Mike Bettencourt will introduce Gnome 3. Matt Meinwald will explain the XFCE desktop environment and Compiz.</p>

<p>Note that the order will likely be different than the one above. Hopefully by the end of the meeting, everyone will know enough about window managers to choose the one(s) that suit them best.</p>

<p>This Thursday, March 10 at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will be having lightning talks on the Open Source projects people are working on. If you have something you are working on, please comment below so I can get an idea of the time limits for these talks. If you don’t hear otherwise, assume they are five minutes each and a maximum of two talks per person. If anyone has a gong to help enforce these guidelines, please let me know. We need to do planning during this meeting as well, so please do your best to stay under time, and bring your meeting ideas.</p>

<p>On Thursday, March 3, at 7PM in Dreese 264, we will be having talks on shells. Dan Thau will explain ZSH, an extremely customizable and powerfull shell. Morgan Goose will present on Bash, a familiar one that still has some tricks up its sleeve. Michael Yanovich will demonstrate either ipython or bpython, a python-based shell. Matt Meinwald will show Fish, a friendlier shell. If anyone else has a shell to present, please feel free to talk for a few minutes on it.

<h2><a href="/open-source-club-website/announcements/2011/02/07/wireless-hacking/">Wireless Hacking</a></h2><span class="date">posted: 02-07-2011</span>
<p>Tonight at 7 pm in <a href="http://www.osu.edu/map/building.php?building=279">Dreese Labs</a> room 264, I, Michael Yanovich, will be covering various sub-topics to wireless hacking, however the main point that I want people to take away from this talk is how to secure your own wireless network from these types of attacks. I’ll be covering a brief outline on how wireless networks work, the several types of encryption available, and other settings that can set to <strong>try</strong> to protect your network. I’ll be demonstrating these attacks as well, and I’ll be needing help in this endeavor and I encourage people to bring their laptops if they wish to participate. I encourage people to follow along and learn the most they can about wireless security. I’m bringing my own equipment for us to attack and I’m giving permission to those who attend to help out and to help show off the weakness of various types or security implementations that I will be covering. I also have surprise raw data information about wifi access points in the Columbus area that will definitely be interesting!</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: We do not encourage the use of any of the software and/or techniques to use be used on any equipment besides equipment that you either own or are given permission explicitly from the owner of said equipment. Also we are <strong>NOT</strong> responsible for the actions people take using these techniques learned at this meeting. All information that is being taught is very <strong>easily</strong> accessible on the Internet. I’m asking those who participate come prepared with the software installed if possible. I know this is late notice but it won’t take more than a few minutes of your time. You can participate in helping me produce information on any system but if you want to follow through with what I’ll be doing you’ll need a laptop with Linux.</p>

<p>There are only two packages they you need: aircrack-ng and “john the ripper.”</p>

<p>Aircrack-ng is available in almost any linux distribution repository. I know it’s available in Ubuntu’s and Fedora’s repositories. However, for “john the ripper” you’ll need to download and compile it for your laptop. You can find it here: http://www.openwall.com/john/g/john-1.7.6.tar.gz</p>

<p>More information in general about John The Ripper: http://www.openwall.com/john/</p>

<p>If you want walk through what I’ll be covering, please come prepared (if possible, with the software installed and ready to go). If you have any trouble respond to the email or catch us on IRC and we’ll help you out.</p>
